# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Abstract
The AI Sales & Lead Outreach Agent is an intelligent, multilingual voice-automation system developed to enhance and scale lead engagement for businesses across diverse linguistic and demographic markets. Leveraging the Gemini API’s advanced speech recognition, natural language understanding, and real-time reasoning capabilities, the agent autonomously conducts follow-up calls, nurtures leads, and delivers personalized information with human-like clarity and empathy. The system is specifically optimized for India’s multilingual ecosystem, supporting regional languages, dialect variations, informal speech patterns, and code-mixed communication styles commonly used by customers.
At the core of the agent’s interaction model is the PESO framework—Pain, Emotion, Solution, and Offer—which guides the generation of persuasive, context-aware responses. This enables the system to not only understand user intent but also identify subtle emotional cues such as hesitation, interest, frustration, or confusion. By dynamically adjusting its conversational tone and strategy, the agent improves user trust, reduces resistance, and increases the chances of conversion compared to conventional automated systems.
The solution integrates robust ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) for accurate real-time transcription, sentiment and emotion detection for deeper behavioral insights, and adaptive response generation to handle incomplete, unexpected, or off-topic replies. Its reasoning engine allows the system to detect conversation mismatches and automatically recover through fallback prompts, clarifications, or redirections—ensuring smooth, uninterrupted dialogue flow without manual intervention.
By automating repetitive follow-ups and lead-qualification tasks, the AI Sales & Lead Outreach Agent significantly reduces operational dependency on large telecalling teams. Businesses can scale outreach to thousands of leads simultaneously, maintain consistent messaging, and provide emotionally aware support even in rural and regional markets where traditional communication barriers exist. This leads to improved customer satisfaction, higher conversion rates, reduced operational costs, and a more efficient, data-driven sales pipeline.
Overall, the proposed solution represents a transformative approach to modern sales communication—combining language intelligence, emotional understanding, and automated persuasion to deliver a scalable, reliable, and deeply personalized sales outreach experience.
